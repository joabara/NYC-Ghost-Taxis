Introduction: 
Nine million people in New York City depend on public transportation to move around the city. The Taxi and Limousine Commission as well as the mayor’s administration is responsible for making sure that the supply of cabs can accommodate the demand at all times of day.

Background: 
While some believe it is an urban legend, there is a very real problemof cabs “disappearing” during the afternoon peak period, as supply fails to meet demand. The New York Times reported that the drop in cabs is consistent regardless of time of year or day of week.

Goals: 
Determine whether there is a significant drop in available cabs during the afternoon peak period, and compare it across three different months to evaluate consistency.

Dataset: 
Taxi trip record data from the months of March, July, and September 2015,to account for different times of the year and days of the week. Due to the immense size of the datasets from each month (roughly 2GB each), it is best to raw a random sample of around 100,000 to draw conclusions on the population for each month.

Figures: 
Frequency of trips vs. time throughout the day. Additionally, should a significant dip in trips occur at a certain period throughout the day, the direction of the trip start and finishes to see if trips are biased towards shift change.

Results: 
If the dips in trips are truly occurring during a certain period of time in relation in shift change, then the direction of the trips during that dip period should roughly be in a direction pointing towards the location where the cabbies must drop off their cabs (the Bronx).
